Additionally, he has a history of delayed payments, with an average delay of 44 days from the due date, and has made 10 delayed payments in the past. This suggests that Langi may not be reliable in making timely payments.\n\nFurthermore, Langi has a high number of credit inquiries (15) and a high credit utilization ratio (26.2%), which may indicate that he is over-extending himself and taking on too much debt. His credit mix is classified as \"Standard\", which may not be ideal, and he has a relatively short credit history age of 160 months.\n\nOn the positive side, Langi has a stable income and a decent monthly in-hand salary, which may suggest that he has the means to repay his debts. However, his payment behavior is classified as \"Low_spent_Small_value_payments\", which may indicate that he is not making significant payments towards his debt.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, the model has determined that Langi's credit health is \"Poor\" and has processed a credit limit of $4178, which is likely a reduced amount compared to what he may have requested. This decision is aimed at protecting both Langi and the lender from potential default or financial difficulties.", "response": "{\n  \"productRecommendations\": {\n    \"Advantage Plus Card\": \"This card is suggested to Langi Chiangi because it offers a suite of benefits, including reward points for every $10 spent, with double points for hotel reservations, mobile top-ups, and retail purchases.
