    ##Feature importaces for all above defined features of the alternative credit scroing technique:
    {feature_importance}

    ##Featurized User profile input to predict the Result(Credit Score Profile):
    {user_profile_ip}

    ## Alternative credit scroing technique inference results:
    - Credit Health={pred}
    - Processed Credit Limit for the user={allowed_credit_limit}

    ##Instruction: 
    - Take into account the Definitions of various feature field and their respective values used to predict a persons Credit Score Health using alternative credit scoring technique.
    - Provide a detailed reason in every day easy to understand language as to explain Credit Health request given Credit Health Status is {pred}.
    - Do not disclose any information about the model or its feature importances.
    - Provide corrective actions to improve the Credit Health and Processed Credit limit only if Credit Health is "Poor" or "Standard".
    - Credit history age below 36 months is considered relatively new credit user.
    
    ##Output:
